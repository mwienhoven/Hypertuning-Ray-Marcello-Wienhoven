# Hypertuning-Ray-Marcello-Wienhoven
The repository for assignment 4-hypertuning-ray for the Portfolio-Marcello-Wienhoven

## Used dataset

The dataset used in this repository can be found in the 
[**CIFAR-10 dataset**](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The dataset used is the CIFAR-10 classification dataset. This dataset contains 60000 samples (50000 training samples and 10000 test samples). There are 10 classes (airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deers, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.) The images are relatively small also with a 32x32 pixel size that helps with the computational speed.

### Flowers102 dataset
In the beginning of developing the code for the assignment, I relied on the Flowers102 dataset, which can be found on [**Flowers Recognition**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition). More info can also be found on [**102 Category Flower Dataset**](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/). This dataset contains 102 classes, and each class contains of between 40 and 258 images (samples). The CNN used in this research just could not perform on this dataset, this dataset is too complex for the simple CNN structure. This is the reason I switched to the CIFAR-10 dataset.
